# Introduction to Authentication Module Project

## Introduction

Use `Node.js`, `Express` and `Knex` to build an API that provides **Register** and **Login** functionality using `SQLite` to store _User_ information. Make sure the password is not stored as plain text.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push -u origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product


Complete the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | /api/register | Creates a `user` using the information sent inside the `body` of the request. **Hash the password** before saving the user to the database.                                                                                                                                                         |
| POST   | /api/login    | Use the credentials sent inside the `body` to authenticate the user. On successful login, create a new session for the user and send back a 'Logged in' message and a cookie that contains the user id. If login fails, respond with the correct status code and the message: 'You shall not pass!' |
| GET    | /api/users    | If the user is logged in, respond with an array of all the users contained in the database. If the user is not logged in repond with the correct status code and the message: 'You shall not pass!'.                                                                                                |

Add support for **sessions** and **cookies**, use them to keep a record of logged in users across requests.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

- Write a piece of **global** middleware that ensures a user is logged in when accessing _any_ route prefixed by `/api/users`.
- Build a React application that implements components to register, login and view a list of users. Gotta keep sharpening your React skills.

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a pull request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
